(which differs from Continual Learning in that data from all tasks is available
at all times).

    """Train our hypernet - main-net combination on all tasks at once (multi-
    task learning).

    Note, there are several ways to do this. There are methods that ignore the
    task identity of samples, e.g.,

        - training the pure main network on a combined dataset (which is the
          typical baseline in the literature)
        - training a combination of main net and hypernet with a single task
          embeddings, such that the hypernetwork is expected to output a set
          of weights that solves all tasks equally good.

    The above baseline methods have arguably less capacity, which is why one
    would expect that they are no fair comparison to our method.

    An alternative strategy is to keep the task identities (i.e., a task
    embedding for each task) and train on a combined dataset. The pitfall
    with this method is, that using a hypernet with minibatches is not
    readily parallelizable. Hence, in an efficient implementation one would
    select a random task_id per mini-batch and only process samples from this
    task-specific dataset.

    The drawback of this method is, that the gradient would always be computed
    based on a single task (no influence of mixed task signals on the gradient).

    To overcome this problem, one would need to loop over task-embeddings to
    compute the weights for different tasks, which results in linearized
    (inefficient) computation.

    This method allows both types of baseline computation, which keep the task
    identity.

        mixed_gradient: If False,in each training iteration a random task will
            be selected and the training step is computed based on samples
            from this task only. If True, random samples from all tasks are
            selected, which means that one has to loop over the generation of
            weights for different tasks (computationally inefficient).
